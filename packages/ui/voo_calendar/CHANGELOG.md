### üì± Responsive Day View

**Intelligent Responsive Layout** - Day view now automatically adapts to screen size for optimal user experience:

#### ‚ú® New Features:
- **FEAT**: Automatic responsive layout detection using `voo_responsive` package
- **FEAT**: Mobile-optimized vertical stacking with dynamic height expansion (<600px width)
- **FEAT**: Desktop/tablet column layout with fixed hour heights (‚â•600px width)
- **FEAT**: Seamless transition between layout modes based on screen width

#### üìê Mobile Behavior (<600px):
- Events stack vertically within their hour slots
- Hour slots automatically expand to fit all events without overlapping
- Dynamic height ensures all events are fully visible
- Perfect for touch interfaces with limited horizontal space

#### üíª Desktop/Tablet Behavior (‚â•600px):
- Google Calendar-style column layout for overlapping events
- Events display side-by-side for better space utilization
- Fixed 80px hour heights for consistent visual rhythm
- Optimal for mouse/trackpad interaction with more screen real estate

#### üîß Implementation Details:
- Uses `context.isMobile` from `voo_responsive` for breakpoint detection
- Automatically enables dynamic height on mobile devices
- Column layout intelligently disabled on mobile to prevent cramped UI
- Minute-precise event positioning works across both layout modes

#### üéØ Developer Experience:
- Zero configuration required - works automatically out of the box
- `enableColumnLayout` setting respected on desktop/tablet only
- Dynamic height expansion automatically enabled on mobile
- Consistent API across all screen sizes

### Use Case
Perfect for building responsive calendar applications that work seamlessly across all device types. The calendar automatically provides the best layout for each screen size without requiring conditional logic in your code.

  - ‚ùå `dayViewEnableDynamicHeight` ‚Üí Use `dayViewConfig.enableDynamicHeight`
  - ‚ùå `dayViewMinEventHeight` ‚Üí Use `dayViewConfig.minEventHeight`
  - ‚ùå `dayViewEventSpacing` ‚Üí Use `dayViewConfig.eventSpacing`

#### ‚ú® New Configuration Classes:
- **FEAT**: `VooDayViewConfig` - Comprehensive day view configuration with 20+ options
- **FEAT**: `VooWeekViewConfig` - Week view configuration for consistent customization
- **FEAT**: `VooMonthViewConfig` - Month view configuration with grid options

- **FEAT**: `VooScheduleViewConfig` - Schedule view customization options

#### üé® Advanced Event Layout System:
- **FEAT**: Google Calendar-style column layout for overlapping events (`enableColumnLayout`)
- **FEAT**: Events can now be displayed side-by-side instead of just stacked
- **FEAT**: Intelligent overlap detection and grouping algorithm
- **FEAT**: Automatic column width calculation based on concurrent events
- **FEAT**: Configurable horizontal gaps between adjacent events (`eventHorizontalGap`)

#### üìê Enhanced Spacing & Positioning:
- **FEAT**: `eventLeftPadding` - Left padding for events to prevent overlap with time labels (default: 8.0)
- **FEAT**: `eventRightPadding` - Right padding for events to prevent overlap with trailing builders (default: 8.0)
- **FEAT**: `eventTopPadding` - Top padding within hour slots (default: 4.0)
- **FEAT**: `eventBottomPadding` - Bottom padding within hour slots (default: 4.0)
- **FEAT**: `trailingBuilderWidth` - Reserved width for trailing builders to prevent event overlap (default: 0)

#### üîß Improved Dynamic Height:
- **FIX**: Dynamic height now properly calculates space for all overlapping events
- **FIX**: Events no longer overlap with `hourLineTrailingBuilder` widgets
- **FIX**: Better spacing calculation includes padding buffers for visual breathing room
- **IMPROVE**: `minEventHeight` default increased from 40.0 to 60.0 for better readability
- **IMPROVE**: `eventSpacing` default increased from 4.0 to 8.0 for improved visual hierarchy

#### üéØ Production-Ready Features:
- **IMPROVE**: Cleaner API with grouped configuration objects
- **IMPROVE**: Better separation of concerns between calendar and view configurations
- **IMPROVE**: More intuitive parameter naming and organization
- **IMPROVE**: Enhanced documentation with clear examples
- **IMPROVE**: TypeScript-style config objects with `copyWith` methods

### Migration Guide

**Before (0.1.x):**
```dart
VooCalendar(
  dayViewHourLineTrailingBuilder: (context, hour) => Icon(Icons.add),
  dayViewShowOnlyHoursWithEvents: true,
  dayViewEnableDynamicHeight: true,
  dayViewMinEventHeight: 40.0,
  dayViewEventSpacing: 4.0,
)
```

**After (0.2.0):**
```dart
VooCalendar(
  dayViewConfig: VooDayViewConfig(
    hourLineTrailingBuilder: (context, hour) => Icon(Icons.add),
    showOnlyHoursWithEvents: true,
    enableDynamicHeight: true,
    enableColumnLayout: true,  // NEW: Google Calendar-style layout
    minEventHeight: 60.0,
    eventSpacing: 8.0,
    eventLeftPadding: 8.0,     // NEW: Prevent overlap with time labels
    eventRightPadding: 8.0,    // NEW: Prevent overlap with trailing builders
    trailingBuilderWidth: 48,  // NEW: Reserve space for trailing widgets
  ),
)
```

### Technical Improvements
- Implemented proper event layout algorithm using column-based positioning
- Added comprehensive padding system to prevent UI element overlaps
- Improved dynamic height calculation with proper spacing buffers
- Enhanced code organization with dedicated configuration classes
- Better type safety with structured configuration objects
- Reduced parameter pollution in main widget constructor

## 0.1.5

### üêõ Bug Fixes

**Day View Time Label Alignment** - Fixed visual misalignment between time labels and events:

#### Fixed Issues:
- **FIX**: Corrected time label vertical alignment - Changed from `Alignment.centerRight` to `Alignment.topRight` to align labels with hour line boundaries
- **FIX**: Removed extra font line spacing by setting `height: 1.0` on time labels
- **FIX**: Added 2px upward offset using `Transform.translate` to compensate for font baseline positioning
- **FIX**: Time labels now perfectly align with event start positions

#### Visual Impact:
- Events starting at 09:00 now visually align exactly with the "09:00" label
- Eliminates the perception that events start 10 minutes before their actual time
- Matches standard calendar app conventions (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, etc.)
- Consistent alignment between day view and week view time labels

### Technical Details
The fix addresses font rendering characteristics where Text widgets have intrinsic line height and baseline offsets that were causing time labels to appear centered in hour slots rather than aligned with the hour boundaries where events actually start.

## 0.1.4

### ‚ú® Dynamic Height for Day View

- **FEAT**: `eventSpacing` - Configure spacing between vertically stacked events (default: 4.0)
- **FEAT**: Smart overlap detection - Calculates maximum overlapping events per hour for optimal layout
- **FEAT**: Automatic event stacking - Events are intelligently positioned to avoid overlap

#### Implementation:
- Hour slots automatically expand based on the number of overlapping events
- Events are vertically stacked with customizable spacing
- Maintains minimum event height for readability
- Seamlessly integrates with existing day view customization options

#### VooCalendar Parameters:
- `dayViewEnableDynamicHeight` - Enable dynamic height adjustment
