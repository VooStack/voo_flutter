### üîÑ Major API Refactor - Composition Over Inheritance

**VooCalendarEventWidget Refactored to Composition Pattern** - Following Flutter best practices and rules.md principles:

#### Breaking Changes:
- **BREAKING**: `VooCalendarEventWidget` is no longer an abstract class
  - **Old** (inheritance): Extend class and override `buildContent()`
  - **New** (composition): Use `child` or `builder` parameters
  - Migration is simple - see guide below

#### Why This Change:
- ‚úÖ **Composition over inheritance** - Core principle from rules.md
- ‚úÖ **Flutter best practice** - Follows pattern of AnimatedBuilder, ValueListenableBuilder
- ‚úÖ **Less boilerplate** - No need to create classes for simple wrappers
- ‚úÖ **More flexible** - Choose between child or builder based on needs
- ‚úÖ **Better DX** - Cleaner, more intuitive API

####New API:

**Approach 1: Builder (when you need event data)**
```dart
VooCalendarEventWidget(
  event: event,
  renderInfo: renderInfo,
  builder: (context, event, renderInfo) {
    return ProductLogListTile(productLog: event.metadata['productLog']);
  },
)
```

**Approach 2: Child (when you don't need event data)**
```dart
VooCalendarEventWidget(
  renderInfo: renderInfo,
  child: ProductLogListTile(productLog: productLog),
)
```

### Migration Guide:

**Before (0.3.x):**
```dart
class ProductEventWidget extends VooCalendarEventWidget {
  final ProductLog productLog;

  const ProductEventWidget({
    super.key,
    required super.event,
    required super.renderInfo,
    required this.productLog,
  });

  @override
  Widget buildContent(BuildContext context) {
    return ProductLogListTile(productLog: productLog);
  }
}

// Usage
return ProductEventWidget(
  event: event,
  renderInfo: renderInfo,
  productLog: productLog,
);
```

**After (0.4.0):**
```dart
// No class needed! Use builder directly
return VooCalendarEventWidget(
  event: event,
  renderInfo: renderInfo,
  builder: (context, event, renderInfo) {
    final productLog = event.metadata?['productLog'] as ProductLog;
    return ProductLogListTile(productLog: productLog);
  },
);
```

### Benefits:
- Less code to maintain
- No inheritance hierarchies
- Follows Flutter conventions
- Easier to understand and use

## 0.3.3

### üîÑ API Improvements - Better Naming

**Renamed `BaseCalendarEventWidget` ‚Üí `VooCalendarEventWidget`** - Improved naming to follow package conventions:

#### Breaking Changes:
- **BREAKING**: `BaseCalendarEventWidget` renamed to `VooCalendarEventWidget`
  - Migration: Simply rename `extends BaseCalendarEventWidget` to `extends VooCalendarEventWidget`
  - All functionality remains identical

#### Improvements:
- **IMPROVE**: Better discoverability - follows `Voo*` naming pattern
- **IMPROVE**: Enhanced documentation with usage examples in class docs
- **IMPROVE**: README reorganized to show `VooCalendarEventWidget` as the primary approach
- **IMPROVE**: Clearer API that communicates official widget for custom events

#### Why This Change:

- Makes it clear this is the official widget for extending calendar events
- More developer-friendly and easier to discover

### Migration Guide:
```dart
// Before (0.3.2)
class MyEventWidget extends BaseCalendarEventWidget {
  ...
}

// After (0.3.3)
class MyEventWidget extends VooCalendarEventWidget {
  ...
}
```

## 0.3.2

### ‚ú® Custom Event Widget Support with Proper Dimension Handling

**New Builder API for Custom Events** - Added proper support for custom event widgets that respect calendar layout dimensions:

#### New Features:
- **FEAT**: `eventBuilderWithInfo` - New event builder that provides render info (allocated dimensions, layout context)
- **FEAT**: `VooCalendarEventRenderInfo` - Data class containing allocated height, width, and layout context
- **FEAT**: `VooCalendarEventWidget` - Abstract base class for creating custom event widgets
- **FEAT**: Automatic dimension handling for custom events in day view
- **FEAT**: Support for custom widgets that properly respect dynamic height and column layouts

#### Problem Solved:
- **FIX**: Custom event widgets (like `ProductLogListTile`) now work correctly with dynamic height
- **FIX**: Events with custom builders no longer ignore allocated dimensions
- **FIX**: Overlapping custom events now stack properly on mobile without overlap
- **FIX**: Custom widgets respect column layout widths on desktop

#### API Changes:
```dart
// OLD: eventBuilder (still works, but doesn't provide dimensions)
VooCalendar(
  eventBuilder: (context, event) => MyCustomWidget(event),
)

// NEW: eventBuilderWithInfo (quick approach)
VooCalendar(
  eventBuilderWithInfo: (context, event, renderInfo) {
    return SizedBox(
      height: renderInfo.allocatedHeight,
      width: renderInfo.allocatedWidth,
      child: MyCustomWidget(event),
    );
  },
)

// BEST: Extend VooCalendarEventWidget (recommended)
class MyEventWidget extends VooCalendarEventWidget {
  @override
  Widget buildContent(BuildContext context) {
    return MyCustomWidget(event);
  }
}
```

#### File Structure (Following Rules.md):
```
lib/src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/entities/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ voo_calendar_event_render_info.dart (NEW)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/atoms/

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes & Architecture Improvements

**Mobile Day View Event Stacking** - Fixed critical bug where overlapping events were not displaying correctly on mobile:

#### Fixed Issues:
- **FIX**: Fixed mobile day view event stacking bug where duplicate events with identical times overlapped instead of stacking
  - **Root Cause**: `indexWhere()` was returning the same index (0) for all events with matching time+title, causing them to render at the same position
  - **Solution**: Implemented pre-calculated stack positions using `Map<VooCalendarEvent, int>` based on sort order
  - **Impact**: All overlapping events now display correctly without overlap on mobile devices
- **FIX**: Events with identical start times now stack vertically with proper spacing
- **FIX**: Each event receives a unique vertical position based on its index in the sorted events list

#### Code Quality & Architecture:
- **IMPROVE**: Refactored calendar views to follow rules.md one-class-per-file principle
  - Split `calendar_views.dart` (6 classes) into individual files
  - Each view now in dedicated file: `voo_calendar_month_view.dart`, `voo_calendar_week_view.dart`, etc.
- **IMPROVE**: Split `EventCardWidget` and `ScheduleEventCardWidget` into separate files
- **IMPROVE**: Organized files following atomic design pattern in `presentation/organisms/`
- **IMPROVE**: Updated `calendar_views.dart` to barrel export file for all view widgets
- **IMPROVE**: Created comprehensive test infrastructure following atomic design
  - Added `test/helpers/test_helpers.dart` for shared test utilities
  - Created `test/presentation/organisms/` structure for view tests
  - Test helpers support multiple screen sizes (mobile/tablet/desktop)

#### File Structure Changes:
```
lib/src/presentation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ atoms/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ event_card_widget.dart (cleaned)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ schedule_event_card_widget.dart (NEW)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ organisms/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ voo_calendar_day_view.dart (NEW - with bug fix)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ voo_calendar_month_view.dart (NEW)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ voo_calendar_schedule_view.dart (NEW)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ voo_calendar_week_view.dart (NEW)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ voo_calendar_year_view.dart (NEW)
```

#### Technical Details:
- Event stack positions are pre-calculated before rendering to ensure consistent positioning
- Sort order based on `startTime` comparison ensures deterministic event ordering
- Mobile detection uses `context.isMobile` for responsive behavior
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing API

### Verification:
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ Zero lint/analyze issues
- ‚úÖ Follows rules.md conventions
- ‚úÖ Mobile day view displays all 5 overlapping events correctly
