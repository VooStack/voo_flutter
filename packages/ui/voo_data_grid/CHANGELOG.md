    * Enhanced handling of between operator to properly handle null min/max values
    * Now only creates GreaterThanOrEqual filter when minimum value is not null

    * Allows filtering with just a minimum or just a maximum value

  * **VooApiStandard Field Name PascalCase**
    * Fixed field names to use PascalCase after the prefix in VooApiStandard
    * When using fieldPrefix='Site' with field='siteNumber', it now correctly generates 'Site.SiteNumber' (not 'Site.siteNumber')
    * This ensures compatibility with backend APIs expecting PascalCase field names
    * Other API standards continue to use the field name as-is without case changes

## 0.5.2

* **Bug Fixes & Improvements**
  * **Fixed Generic Type Propagation**: Fixed missing generic type parameters in widget tree
    * Added generic type parameter `<T>` to `VooDataGridFilterRow`, `VooDataGridHeader`, and `VooDataGridRow` widget instantiations

    * Improved error logging with detailed type information for debugging
    * Better error messages when valueGetter is missing for typed objects
    * Graceful fallback to null values on errors instead of crashing
  
  * **VooApiStandard Number Range Fix**: Fixed number range filtering for Voo API Standard
    * Number ranges now correctly use GreaterThanOrEqual and LessThanOrEqual operators
    * Removed unsupported 'Between' operator from Voo API Standard
    * Creates two separate filters for range queries as expected by the API
    * Example: Site.siteNumber between 0 and 100 now sends:
      * `{fieldName: 'Site.siteNumber', value: 0, operator: 'GreaterThanOrEqual'}`
      * `{fieldName: 'Site.siteNumber', value: 100, operator: 'LessThanOrEqual'}`
  
  * **Filter Visibility During Errors**: Fixed filters disappearing when data loading fails
    * Headers and filter row now remain visible even when there's an error
    * Users can adjust filters and retry without losing their filter state
    * Error message appears in the data area while preserving the grid structure
    * Improves user experience by maintaining context during error states

* **Developer Experience**
  * Added detailed debug logging for type mismatches
  * Created comprehensive error handling tests
  * Better documentation of type safety requirements

  * Enables cleaner column definitions while maintaining proper API field names
  
* **New Feature: Action Columns and Clickable Cells**
  * Added `excludeFromApi` property to exclude columns from API requests (useful for action columns)
  * Added `onCellTap` callback for making cells clickable
  * Updated filter row to skip columns with `excludeFromApi` flag
  * Updated header to prevent sorting on excluded columns
  * Added InkWell wrapper for cells with onCellTap callback
  
* **Use Cases**
  * Nested properties: `Site.SiteNumber`, `Client.CompanyName`, `Order.Status`
  * Action buttons (edit, delete, view) that shouldn't be sent to API
  * Clickable cells for quick actions
  * Local-only columns that don't exist in the backend
  
* **Examples**
  * `nested_field_example.dart`: Demonstrates field prefix usage
  * `action_buttons_example.dart`: Shows action columns with edit/delete/view buttons
  
* **Testing**
  * Added tests for field prefix functionality
  * Added tests for excludeFromApi and onCellTap features
  * All existing tests pass without modifications

* **Type Safety Improvements**
  * `valueGetter` in VooDataColumn now has proper type signature: `dynamic Function(T row)`
  * `cellBuilder` callback now receives properly typed row: `Widget Function(BuildContext, dynamic value, T row)`
  * `onRowTap` and `onRowDoubleTap` callbacks now receive typed data: `void Function(T row)`
  * `cardBuilder` for mobile layout now has type safety: `Widget Function(BuildContext, T row, int index)`

* **Developer Experience**
  * No more casting needed in valueGetter: `(row) => row.orderId` instead of `(row) => (row as OrderModel).orderId`
  * Better IDE support with autocomplete and error detection
  * Cleaner, more maintainable code with compile-time type checking
  * Backward compatible - can still use `dynamic` for untyped/Map data

* **Example Updates**
  * Updated VooDataGridTypedObjectsPreview to demonstrate generic usage
