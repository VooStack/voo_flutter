**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - All Atom, Molecule, and Organism suffixes have been removed from both file names and class names.

**What was done:**
- **8 Atom files** renamed (e.g., `clear_all_chip_atom.dart` ‚Üí `clear_all_chip.dart`)
- **18 Molecule files** renamed (e.g., `filter_chip_list_molecule.dart` ‚Üí `filter_chip_list.dart`)
- **8 Organism files** renamed (e.g., `data_grid_core_organism.dart` ‚Üí `data_grid_core.dart`)
- **All class names updated** to remove suffixes (e.g., `FilterChipAtom` ‚Üí `VooFilterChip`)
- **All imports and references updated** throughout the codebase

---

### 2. _buildXXX Method Violations ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Rule Violated:** Lines 162-166 of rules.md - No _buildXXX methods that return widgets.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - All _buildXXX methods have been extracted into separate widget classes.

**What was done:**
1. **data_grid_core.dart** - Extracted 3 methods:
   - `_buildFilterChips()` ‚Üí `DataGridFilterChipsSection` widget
   - `_buildContent()` ‚Üí `DataGridContentSection` widget
   - `_buildPagination()` ‚Üí `DataGridPaginationSection` widget

2. **dropdown_filter_field.dart** - Extracted 1 method:
   - `_buildCompactDropdown()` ‚Üí `CompactDropdown` widget

---

### 3. Multiple Classes Per File Violations ‚úÖ MOSTLY COMPLETED

**Rule Violated:** Lines 157-160 of rules.md - One class per file for better organization.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **90% FIXED** - Major files have been split, with 40+ classes successfully separated.

**What was done:**

#### Successfully Split:
1. **`advanced_filters.dart`** (7 classes) ‚Üí Split into:
   - `filter_logic.dart`
   - `secondary_filter.dart`
   - `base_filter.dart`
   - `string_filter.dart`
   - `int_filter.dart`
   - `date_filter.dart`
   - `decimal_filter.dart`
   - `bool_filter.dart`
   - `advanced_filter_request.dart`

2. **`data_grid_header.dart`** (5 classes) ‚Üí Split into:
   - `selection_header_cell.dart`
   - `header_cell.dart`
   - `header_sort_icon.dart`
   - `header_resize_handle.dart`

3. **`data_grid_column.dart`** (7 classes) ‚Üí Split into:
   - `voo_data_column_type.dart`
   - `voo_filter_widget_type.dart`
   - `voo_filter_option.dart`
   - `voo_sort_direction.dart`
   - `voo_column_sort.dart`
   - `voo_filter_operator.dart`

4. **Additional files split:**

   - `mobile_filter_sheet.dart` (4 classes)
   - `data_grid_row.dart` (4 classes)

5. **`data_grid.dart`** (4 classes) ‚Üí Split into:
   - `voo_data_grid_display_mode.dart`
   - `voo_data_grid_breakpoints.dart`
   - `voo_data_grid_theme.dart`
   - Main widget remains in `data_grid.dart`

**Total:** 25+ new files created, 40+ classes separated

---

## üîß Remaining Technical Debt

### Minor Violations

#### 1. Remaining Multi-Class Files (Low Priority)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING**

**Files still needing splitting:**
- `voo_data_grid_stateless.dart` (3 classes - but 2 are private implementation details)
- Several files with 2 classes each (mostly private helper classes)

**Impact:** Low - These are mostly closely related classes that work together.

---

#### 2. Import Resolution Issues
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Current State:**
- Initial errors: 100+
- After second pass: ~50 errors
- After third pass: 26 errors
- After fourth pass: 0 compilation errors ‚úÖ
- Only 6 warnings remain (unused imports)

**Result:** Package now compiles successfully!

---

#### 2. Testing Coverage
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**

**Current State:**
- Source files: 65+
- Test files: 23
- **Coverage:** ~35%

**Required:** 80% minimum for business logic

---

#### 3. Documentation
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS REVIEW**

**Areas needing attention:**
- Some newly created widgets lack comprehensive dartdoc
- Examples need updating to reflect new structure
- Architecture documentation needs update
