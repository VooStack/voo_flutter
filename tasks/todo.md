# VooDataGrid Advanced Filtering Implementation Plan

## Objective
Enhance VooDataGrid to support advanced remote filtering with secondary filters, multiple filter types (string, int, date, decimal), and fix horizontal scrolling issues.

## Todo List

### Phase 1: Core Filter Models
- [ ] Create enhanced filter model classes with secondary filter support
  - [ ] BaseFilter abstract class with operator and secondary filter
  - [ ] StringFilter, IntFilter, DateFilter, DecimalFilter implementations
  - [ ] SecondaryFilter model with logic operator (And/Or)
  - [ ] FilterRequest model to combine all filter types

### Phase 2: Remote Data Source Updates
- [ ] Update VooRemoteDataSource to handle complex filter requests
  - [ ] Modify buildFilterParams to support new filter structure
  - [ ] Handle legacy filter format for backwards compatibility
  - [ ] Support both simple and complex filter formats

### Phase 3: Scrolling Fixes
- [ ] Fix horizontal scrolling to work uniformly across the data grid
  - [ ] Ensure left-to-right scrolling is consistent
  - [ ] Synchronize header and body scrolling
  - [ ] Handle frozen columns properly

### Phase 4: Advanced Filter Widget
- [ ] Create AdvancedFilterWidget for complex filtering UI
  - [ ] Filter builder interface for each filter type
  - [ ] Secondary filter configuration
  - [ ] Logic operator selection (And/Or)
  - [ ] Filter preview and validation

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Update example app to demonstrate advanced filtering
  - [ ] Add examples with secondary filters
  - [ ] Show different filter types in action
  - [ ] Demonstrate legacy compatibility
- [ ] Test all filtering scenarios
- [ ] Update README documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Keep changes simple and focused
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing filter formats
- Use clean architecture principles
- Follow atomic design for UI components
- No relative imports

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Advanced Filter Support**: Full support for the complex JSON filter format with stringFilters, intFilters, dateFilters, and decimalFilters
2. **Secondary Filters**: Each filter can have a secondary condition with And/Or logic
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy filter formats still work alongside new advanced filters
4. **Synchronized Scrolling**: Header and body now scroll together uniformly
5. **Filter UI Widget**: Complete UI for building complex filters without code
